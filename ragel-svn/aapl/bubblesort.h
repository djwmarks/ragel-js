/** 
 * \class BubbleSort
 * \brief Bubble sort an array of data.
 *
 * BubbleSort can be used to sort any array of objects of type T provided a
 * compare class is given. BubbleSort is in-place. It does not require any
 * temporary storage.
 *
 * Objects are not made aware that they are being moved around in memory.
 * Assignment operators, constructors and destructors are never invoked by the
 * sort.
 *
 * BubbleSort runs in O(n^2) time. It is most useful when sorting arrays that
 * are nearly sorted. It is best when neighbouring pairs are out of place.
 * BubbleSort is a stable sort, meaning that objects with the same key have
 * their relative ordering preserved.
